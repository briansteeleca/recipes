In war, the soldiers who build bridges, repair roads, clear minefields and conduct demolitions — all under combat conditions — are known as _sappers_.

For web developers, the stakes are generally lower than those for combat engineers. But we face our own hostile environment: underpowered devices, poor network connections, and the complexity inherent in front-end engineering. Sapper, which is short for **S**velte **app** mak**er**, is your courageous and dutiful ally.

This is an update for the posts page. I would rather not build every time that I make a change. So I'm going to add some new text, and hope that a manual sync will be required to build.

It seems to work well. I'm going to **bold some text**, and then make some *italicized text just for fun*. But please don't build until I tell you to. Thank-you.

And here's a list:

 1. Do this first
 2. And then you can do this
 3. Be sure to do this step last!
