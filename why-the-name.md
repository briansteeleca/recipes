In war, the soldiers who build bridges, repair roads, clear minefields and conduct demolitions — all under combat conditions — are known as _sappers_.

For web developers, the stakes are generally lower than those for combat engineers. But we face our own hostile environment: underpowered devices, poor network connections, and the complexity inherent in front-end engineering. Sapper, which is short for **S**velte **app** mak**er**, is your courageous and dutiful ally. Thank you.
